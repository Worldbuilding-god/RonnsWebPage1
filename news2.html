        <p>Will be manufactured for the Galactic military by November 19 2124. Briar inc. Have this to say:</p>
        <h2><cite>We believe this is the most advanced AdA rifle to ever be produced En mass. It has a 168 hour battery life and can take most common charger variants. It launches the Pellet at about 4765 feet per second. The pellets it can take are the 1in pellets of most kinds, The owners manual will tell you more info.</cite></h2> Briar inc. CEO Oct 19 2124
        <p>
            The internal clock has some concerns due to it being quite new, But Brair inc. Claims that this is no problem since it had been "thouroghly tested".
