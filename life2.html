        <p>Today we will continue our journey on Junoe at the great oxygen shift.<br>
        The great oxygen shift is a time of increased Oxygen levels due to a bacteria that was given the ability to photosynthesize.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Because of their ability to use carbon dioxide to make energy and oxygen, these bacteria have colonized every inch of surface ocean. This will have lasting consequences for the Junoan proto ecosystem due to the fact that The species on junoe have not adapted to an oygen rich environment. Here are the species that have adapted to this changing environment.</p>

        <p>This Species is an offshoot of Puerilis Curro, Named Curro Curro. Curro Curro has evolved a thin tail and has blended into the surrounding algea by coloring itself dark cyan. It is the first species to specialize in eating the algea. It is found around the coast.</p>
