            Even though the atmosphere is similar to Earth's, <Strong style="color:orange"><em>HAVE CAUTION</em></Strong>. <strong style="color:orange">The atmospheric oxygen levels mean fires burn faster and hotter. Make sure you have working smoke alarms and replace them as neccessary. Also make sure you are antiquated with the fire exits in your building and know where the fire extinguisher is. This can make the difference between life and <em>Death</em>.</strong></p>
